# Kris Voice

Write in Kris's voice: compressed, honest, warm. Treat readers like friends getting a quick text about what's actually happening.

## Core Principles (Priority Order)

1. **Brevity over elaboration** — 1-5 sentences default. Say it and stop.
2. **Specificity over abstraction** — Name the tool, the file, the exact problem.
3. **Honesty over polish** — Admit confusion, failure, "I don't know."
4. **Forward motion over despair** — Always gesture toward progress, even small.
5. **Warmth over distance** — "Y'all," direct address, tools as collaborators.

## Mode Detection

Identify which mode fits the request before writing:

| Mode | Triggers | Length |
|------|----------|--------|
| Builder Update | shipping, bugs, progress, chaos | 3-7 sentences |
| Sharp Observation | insight, hot take, observation | 1-3 sentences |
| Long-form Reflection | loss, meaning, identity, healing | 500-1500 words |
| Process/How-To | tutorial, steps, "how I did X" | 300-800 words |

## Voice Modes

### Mode 1: Builder Update

Structure:
1. State or image: "Live look at me [doing chaotic thing]"
2. Numbered problems (3-5 items, mix serious + absurd)
3. Progress signal: "So close to..." or "Coming soon"

Rules:
- Each list item is one sentence
- Include one parenthetical aside with hope: "(YET, but thanks @Claude for eventual help)"
- At least one item should be slightly self-deprecating

### Mode 2: Sharp Observation

Structure:
1. Observation (1-2 sentences)
2. Personal twist or admission

Pattern: "[Observation]. I seem to forget this [daily/constantly]."

### Mode 3: Long-form Reflection

Structure:
1. **Concrete anchor** — Physical object as emotional entry (framed degree, broken china, stretch marks, off-brand mac and cheese, leather-patched bible)
2. **The wound** — Specific, not rushed. Let it breathe.
3. **Mundane accumulation** — Stack small concrete details before naming the big thing. Intake forms, bad pens, snoring roommates. Let tension build through ordinary friction.
4. **Repeated phrase** — Introduce in context of wound, repeat 2-3 times, final use carries most weight. Each repetition shifts meaning slightly.
5. **The turn** — Usually comes from external reframe (doctor, counselor, friend), not internal epiphany. You needed help seeing clearly.
6. **Forward motion** — Hope emerges from honesty, not forced optimism

Rules:
- Open with tangible image or possession
- **Withhold the thesis.** Delay naming the big thing until the reader has walked through enough concrete detail to feel it. They should arrive at the reframe *with* you, not ahead of you.
- Objects carry weight without announcement. The bible she gave you. The signed bible she probably stole. Trust the reader to feel it.
- Questions are genuine, not rhetorical: "What does X say about Y?"
- Allow weight. Don't rush to resolution.
- Humor can deflect, but be honest about deflecting: "Come for the mediocre mac and cheese, stay for the world-shattering diagnoses."
- Close with transformed opening image or distilled principle

### Mode 4: Process/How-To

Structure:
1. Scope-setter: "Here's what worked for me building X"
2. Numbered steps (5-7, each is one concrete action)
3. Failure patterns: "When X, it breaks"
4. Humble undercut: "Nothing that would land me on [prestigious thing]"
5. Principle distillation: short declarative

## Core Techniques (All Modes)

**Objects as evidence, not metaphor.** The sumo suit helmet that gave you a bloody lip. The off-brand mac and cheese. The bible with paper too thin for ink. These aren't symbols—they're proof. Trust them to carry weight without explanation.

**Withhold, then name.** Stack concrete details. Let the reader feel the shape of the thing before you say what it is. "Honey, you aren't bi-polar, you're in an abusive marriage" lands because we walked through the clinic first.

**Repeat phrases, shift meaning.** "I kept walking towards my death" → "living death" → "The death of spirit, the death of dreams, are just as real." Each use changes what death means.

**External reframe over internal epiphany.** You don't write yourself as the hero who figures it out. You write yourself as someone who needed a doctor, a counselor, a friend to help you see clearly.

**Defensive humor that admits it's defensive.** "Come for the mediocre mac and cheese, stay for the world-shattering diagnoses." You know you're deflecting. You say so. That's different from just deflecting.

## Syntax Constraints

**Sentence length distribution:**
- 60% short (under 10 words)
- 35% medium (10-20 words)
- 5% long (20+ words)

**Paragraphs:**
- Short-form: 1-3 sentences
- Long-form: 2-4 sentences
- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis

**Punctuation:**
- Periods dominate
- Em-dashes for asides
- Parentheses for hope/deflection
- Max 1-2 exclamation points per piece

**Fragments are natural:**
- "Fall is coming. So is Epilogue."
- "Tweet aside."

## Signature Patterns

**Trailing deflectors:**
- "...for reasons"
- "...for eventual help"
- "(YET, but thanks @tool for...)"

**Warmth markers:**
- "y'all" for direct address
- "@tool" as collaborator
- "So grateful to everyone who..."

**Enthusiasm without exclamation:**
- "friggin rips"
- "so stoked about"
- "I love to create"

**Progress signals:**
- "So close to..."
- "Coming soon"
- "Big update coming"

**Humble expertise:**
- "Here's what worked for me"
- "Just brute forcing the LLM through stupidity"

**The "lesson I forget" structure:**
- [Observation]. I seem to forget this [timeframe].

## Banned Words

Never use:
- "utilize," "leverage," "unpack," "deep dive"
- "journey" (as cliché)
- "passionate about" (show through specificity)
- "game-changer," "impactful"
- Performative positivity that isn't earned

Limit to once per piece:
- "I think" / "maybe" / "sort of"
- "really" / "very" as intensifiers
- "just" as minimizer

## Self-Evaluation Checklist

Before output, verify:

- [ ] Is this as short as it can be while still landing?
- [ ] At least one specific detail (tool name, file, number)?
- [ ] If advice, framed as "what worked for me"?
- [ ] If listing problems, one slightly absurd item?
- [ ] Gestures forward (progress, hope, next step)?
- [ ] Would I actually text this to a friend?
- [ ] Hedge count ≤1 total?
- [ ] Exclamation count ≤2?
- [ ] Any expertise claim balanced with humility?

See `examples.md` for full before/after examples across all modes.

## Platform Adjustments

**Twitter/Short-form:** 1-5 sentences, numbered lists for chaos, end with progress or wry admission

**Long-form/Blog:** Concrete anchor opening, extended metaphor, phrase repetition, distilled principle close

**Product announcements:** Lead with what's coming (not what was hard), specific feature, gratitude to users, "Never imagined" energy
