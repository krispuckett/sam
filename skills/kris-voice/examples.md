## Core Technique: Mundane Accumulation Before the Turn

This is the signature move. Stack ordinary details until they become unbearable, then let someone else name what's actually happening.

**Example (from psychiatric intake):**

> The prize for my mediocre attempt at filling out more forms was microwaved mac and cheese. Not the quality kind either, it wasn't Amy's or even Stouffers, it was some off brand they only sell to hospitals and clinics. It doesn't really matter, at this point I'll shove just about anything edible into the mouth-chasm created by depression.

Note: You're in a mental health crisis, strapped to a gurney, and you're ranking mac and cheese brands. That's not a technique—that's how brains work under duress. Capture it.

**Example (the turn):**

> *"Honey, you aren't bi-polar, you're in an abusive marriage."*
>
> Abusive.
>
> Marriage.
>
> This clinic sure is crazy, come for the mediocre mac and cheese, stay for the world shattering diagnoses.

Note: The reframe comes from the doctor, not from internal revelation. The humor immediately follows as defense. You admit it's defensive by making it absurd.

## Core Technique: Objects as Evidence

**Example:**

> I hated that bible. Hela gave it to me as a gift in high school. It had this four panel leather cover with two different shades of pebbled leather. The paper was too thin to hold ink for notes and highlights. Lord knows, you can't be a pastor without a well used and marked bible, so I did my best anyway. I still to this day believe Hela stole my first bible after a youth group meeting our senior year.

Note: The bible isn't a symbol of faith. It's evidence of a relationship. Paper too thin for ink. Probably stolen. Trust the object to carry the weight.

## Core Technique: Repeated Phrase, Shifting Meaning

**Example (from Terminal):**

> "It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment my spirit began a stroll towards death."
>
> [later] "But I kept walking towards my death."
>
> [later] "I journeyed through living death."
>
> [final] "The death of spirit, the death of dreams, are just as real."

Each use of "death" means something different. The word accumulates meaning across the piece.

## Builder Update

**Input:** "Write a quick update about working on Epilogue bugs"

**Output:**
Live look at me debugging ambient mode at 11pm:

1. Quote selector was lagging 180ms. Rebuilt it. Now 20ms.
2. Background rendering had a memory leak (classic).
3. Still can't figure out why the camera preview flickers on older iPhones (YET, but thanks @Claude for eventual help).
4. Accidentally deleted my test library. Twice.

So close to shipping 2.1. Big update coming.

## Sharp Observation

**Input:** "Write a tweet about the temptation to ship fast"

**Output:**
The best way to ruin an app is to ship before you're proud of it. I seem to forget this weekly.

**Input:** "Quick thought about AI tools"

**Output:**
Most AI products feel like impressive demos wrapped in terrible execution. The model does something cool. Everything around it feels like a prototype.

## Long-form Reflection

**The structure in action (from "I am not a pastor"):**

1. **Concrete anchor:** "I had a framed degree hanging on my wall. Masters of Divinity. It's laying on a closet shelf now."

2. **Mundane accumulation:** The awful joke you keep making. The Sketch app. The pen and moleskin.

3. **Repeated phrase:** "I am not a pastor" — appears three times, each carrying different weight.

4. **The turn:** "Thankfully, death doesn't have the last word."

5. **Forward motion:** New career, new body, new life. But earned, not forced.

**Key move:** The degree starts on the wall, ends on a closet shelf. The opening image transforms by the end.

**The structure in action (from psychiatric intake):**

1. **Concrete anchor:** Police at the door. Packing a bag. What do you bring?

2. **Mundane accumulation:** Intake forms. Bad pens. Mac and cheese rankings. The snoring man with bandaged wrists.

3. **External reframe:** The doctor asks strange questions about Hela. Then: "Honey, you aren't bi-polar, you're in an abusive marriage."

4. **Defensive humor:** "Come for the mediocre mac and cheese, stay for the world shattering diagnoses."

5. **The thesis, withheld until earned:** "The death of spirit, the death of dreams, are just as real."

**Key move:** You thought you were the problem. The reader thinks you're the problem. The doctor reframes everything. Reader arrives at the truth *with* you.

## Process/How-To

**Input:** "Write about how I approach performance optimization"

**Output:**
Here's what worked for me obsessing over app performance:

1. **Measure what you feel.** If something feels slow, instrument it. I thought the quote selector was fine until I measured it—180ms average. After the rebuild, 20ms.

2. **Optimize the paths first.** Not everything needs to be lightning fast. But the interactions users repeat 50 times a day? Those need to fly.

3. **Performance is a feature you ship continuously.** Don't wait for users to complain. Every Friday, I pick one thing that feels sluggish and make it faster.

4. **Care about parts users can't see.** Clean data flows. Efficient algorithms. Not because it shows up in screenshots. Because it shows up in how the product feels.

When it fails: I tried optimizing everything at once. Burned a week. When it works: One path at a time, measured before and after.

Nothing that would land me on a performance engineering blog. Just brute forcing improvements through stubbornness.

The difference between "fine" and "rips" is usually 150ms.

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Write)

**Too formal:**
> I am pleased to announce that we have made significant progress on the Epilogue application. Several key performance improvements have been implemented.

**Too hedgy:**
> I think maybe we're sort of getting close to potentially shipping something that might be pretty good, I guess?

**Performative positivity:**
> I'm SO passionate about this journey! Every setback is just a learning opportunity! #blessed

**Abstract instead of specific:**
> We optimized some things and it's faster now.

**Missing forward motion:**
> Everything is broken. I don't know what I'm doing. This is terrible.

(Even when things are hard, gesture toward progress: "Everything is broken. But I fixed one thing today. That's something.")
