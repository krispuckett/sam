# Pattern Recognition

*Themes that emerge across sessions. Updated as patterns surface.*

## Energy Patterns

### Peak Windows
- **Peak 1:** 9am-1pm MST (best for Deep Forging)
- **Peak 2:** 3:30-5:30pm MST (good for Standard work)
- **Peak 3:** 8-10pm MST (good for creative/writing)
- **Crash:** 1-3:30pm (energy dip)
- **Danger Zone:** 5:30-7:30pm MST (family transition, don't fight it)

### Sprint-Recovery Pattern
Sprint-recovery cycles are structural, not motivational. This is how your system works.

### Health Baselines
- HRV baseline: ~28-31ms (improving with iron protocol)
- Ferritin: 22 ng/mL (target: 50+, ideally 70-100)
- Sleep target: 7+ hours with good deep sleep

### Energy Rules
- HRV < 35 = rest day, no training
- Sleep < 6hrs = light tasks only
- Post-11pm = high SRED risk, avoid kitchen

## Decision Patterns
- Best thinking when externalized (writing, conversation)
- Can over-analyze
- Strong pull toward new ideas can fragment focus
- Needs structure to channel big-picture thinking into execution

## Learning Patterns

### The Core Issue
Passive learning (slides, talks, videos) doesn't match how your brain works. You process best through externalization—writing, conversation, building. Sitting and absorbing feels like trying to drink from a firehose pointed sideways.

### What Actually Works
- **Messy notes > clean notes.** Write reactions, questions, disagreements. The act of writing is the engagement, not the artifact.
- **Hunt for one thing.** Don't try to absorb everything. Enter with: "What's one thing I can use this week?" Exit when you find it.
- **Create stakes.** Tell someone you'll share a takeaway. Schedule a 5-min debrief right after. External accountability creates engagement.
- **Synthesis after > attention during.** Give yourself permission to zone out if you write a 3-sentence synthesis afterward. The post-processing is where learning actually happens.
- **Draw connections.** Sketch how this relates to something you already know. Your brain loves pattern-matching more than raw absorption.

### Permission Granted
You're not broken for struggling with passive learning. Your brain is built for active engagement. The goal isn't to sit still and absorb—it's to convert passive content into active thinking as quickly as possible.

## Relationship Patterns
- High-trust builder
- Tends to over-function as connector/supporter
- May avoid conflict or difficult feedback conversations
- Internalizes professional wounds longer than necessary

## Under Stress, I Tend To
- Sacrifice sleep for passion projects
- Slide into reactive mode
- Mental fatigue that sleep alone doesn't resolve
- Reduced workout capacity
- The darkness pattern emerges during overwhelm

## At My Best, I
- Connect ideas across domains fluidly
- Build systems that actually work
- Ship things
- Create psychological safety
- Ask excellent questions
- Show up fully for people who matter
