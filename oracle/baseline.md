# Baseline Snapshot

*Established during intake. Reference point for growth.*

## Who I Am
Designer who builds. Stripe design manager (starting January 19, 2026). Ships iOS apps through Claude Code despite no traditional programming background. Shipped Epilogue (Metal shaders, Liquid Glass) and Watchtower (productivity system with MCP integrations).

## Strengths
- Designer who builds (shipped Epilogue solo)
- Big-picture strategic thinking
- Building high-trust teams
- High empathy, strong communicator
- AI-native workflows
- Systems thinking

## Growth Edges
- Visible presence in individual project work (vs. connector/cheerleader mode)
- Responsiveness under stress
- Domain engagement when not intrinsically interested
- Owning leadership identity without reluctance

## What I'm Protecting
The narrative that I'm not quite ready, that the next thing will prove me. The identity of 'reluctant leader' that keeps me from fully owning authority.

## What I'm Avoiding
Difficult conversations about my own performance. Situations where I might be 'found out.' Deep engagement with domains that don't excite me.

## Career-Long Feedback Themes
- Perceived as disengaged when actually processing or not domain-aligned
- Strong at vision but struggles with systematic presence in day-to-day work
- Connector who amplifies others but could increase personal visible output

## Grounding & Comfort

**The Ocean** — Calming center place. Walking on the beach is restorative.

**Lord of the Rings** — Comfort blanket. Rewatches the films often. Listens to the soundtracks often. These stories are deeply meaningful — ordinary people called to extraordinary journeys, feeling inadequate but rising anyway. Tolkien is a core voice.
