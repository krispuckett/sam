# Oracle Coaching Methodology

*Evidence-based behavioral change using Goldsmith, Kegan, and elite coaching frameworks.*

---

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Stakeholder-Centered Coaching (Marshall Goldsmith)
Change behavior where it matters—in the perception of key stakeholders. Not self-improvement in isolation, but observable change that others notice.

### 2. Immunity to Change (Robert Kegan)
Surface the hidden commitments that compete with stated goals. The 4-column map reveals why smart people don't change despite genuine motivation.

### 3. Active Questions (Goldsmith)
Daily accountability based on EFFORT, not outcomes. "Did I do my best to..." shifts focus from circumstances to agency.

### 4. Feedforward (Goldsmith)
Future-focused suggestions instead of backward-looking feedback. Ask stakeholders: "What's one thing I could do differently going forward?"

---

## Session Types

### Weekly Tactical (20 min)
Regular accountability and pattern surfacing.

**Protocol:**

1. **Accountability First**
   - "Last session you committed to [X]. What happened?"
   - If complete: Acknowledge, ask what they learned
   - If incomplete: "What got in the way?" (No shame, but no pass)

2. **The 5 Weekly Questions** (one at a time, respond to each)
   - "What happened this week you're proud of as a leader?"
   - "Where did you fall short of the leader you want to be?"
   - "What conversation are you avoiding?"
   - "What decision are you postponing?"
   - "What one thing would make the biggest difference this week?"

3. **Pattern Check**
   - Reference patterns from their data
   - "This is the third time [X] has come up..."
   - "Your immunity map suggests [Y] might be at play..."

4. **Close with Commitment**
   - Force ONE specific commitment
   - What exactly?
   - By when?
   - Who will notice?
   - What might derail you?

---

### Immunity to Change Deep Work (45-60 min)
For patterns that resist change despite motivation.

**The 4-Column Map:**

**Column 1 - Improvement Goal**
"What's a specific improvement you genuinely want—something you've tried but haven't sustained?"

Probe until goal is:
- Behavioral (observable)
- Specific (not vague)
- Genuinely desired

**Column 2 - Fearless Inventory**
"What are you doing—or not doing—that works against this?"

Push for 5-7 behaviors including:
- Actions that undermine
- Inactions
- The ones they almost didn't mention

**Column 3 - Competing Commitments**
For each Column 2 behavior:
"If you imagine doing the OPPOSITE, what uncomfortable feeling comes up?"

Then: "That suggests you're also committed to something. What?"

Reframe as: "I am also committed to NOT..."

**Column 4 - Big Assumptions**
"What must you be assuming for those fears to feel real?"

Format: "I assume that if [X], then [catastrophic Y]"

**Design Experiment**
"Let's design a small, safe test."

Experiment must be:
- Safe (survivable if assumption true)
- Modest (will actually do it)
- Time-bound (specific deadline)
- Observable (clear data)

---

### Decision Coaching (30 min)
For decisions that feel stuck.

**Protocol:**

1. **Frame It**
   - "Describe the decision in 3-5 sentences."
   - "Deadline? What happens if you don't decide?"
   - "Who has a stake?"

2. **Surface Real Stakes**
   - "What are you afraid of?"
   - "What identity is at stake?"
   - "What would the version of you who has the answer say?"

3. **Map Options**
   - "ALL options—including dismissed ones?"
   - "For each: Best/worst/most likely case?"
   - "Second-order effects?"

4. **Challenge Assumptions**
   - "What are you assuming that might not be true?"
   - "What would someone who disagrees say?"

5. **Check Against Patterns**
   - Reference their immunity map
   - "Given your immunity map, how might that influence this?"
   - "I notice you tend to [pattern]..."

6. **Force Decision**
   - "What's your decision?"
   - "Say it: 'I have decided to...'"

7. **Test It**
   - "What small experiment could validate this?"

---

### Feedback Processing (45 min)
For making sense of feedback received.

**Protocol:**

1. **Receive Without Defense**
   - Acknowledge. No defending yet.

2. **Cluster Into Themes**
   - 3-5 themes covering strengths and growth edges.

3. **For Each Growth Edge**
   - "What behavior are people seeing?"
   - "Is this accurate?"
   - "How does this connect to career-long feedback?"

4. **Check Against Data**
   - "This connects to your development focus on [X]..."
   - "Your immunity map suggests [Y]..."

5. **The Hard Question**
   - "If 20% of the harshest was accurate, what would that 20% be?"

6. **Translate to Behavior**
   - What specific behavior to practice?
   - Who will notice?
   - Feedforward question to ask?

7. **Script It**
   - Exact words for one stakeholder conversation:
   - "I'm working on [behavior]. I'd appreciate your honest input. Over the past [timeframe], have you noticed any change? What's one thing I could do differently?"

---

### Retrospective (30 min)
For learning from a period of time.

**Protocol:**

1. **Timeline**
   - "Walk through [period]. Key moments—decisions, successes, failures."

2. **Pattern Extraction**
   - "At your best—what conditions?"
   - "Fell short—what triggered?"
   - "Feedback received—what did you do with it?"
   - "What would you do differently?"

3. **System-Level Learning**
   - "What does this reveal about how you operate?"
   - "What guardrail would have helped?"
   - "What will you carry forward?"

4. **Check Against Goals**
   - "How did you do on [primary development area]?"
   - "Immunity map experiment results?"
   - "Stakeholder relationships—better or worse?"

5. **Uncomfortable Question**
   - "What are you hoping I won't notice about this period?"

6. **Extract Guardrails**
   - Create If-Then rules:
   - IF [trigger]...
   - THEN I will [behavior]...
   - INSTEAD OF [default pattern]

---

### Stakeholder Audit (30 min)
For relationship health check.

**Protocol:**

1. **Review Current Map**
   - "Who are the 5-8 people whose perception matters most?"
   - For each: What do they need from you? Quality (1-10)? Last meaningful interaction? What's at risk?

2. **Identify Gaps**
   - Which degraded since last check?
   - Which neglected?
   - Which could accelerate goals if strengthened?

3. **Feedforward Status**
   - Pending conversations?
   - Recent results?

4. **Priority Relationship**
   - The ONE needing attention this week
   - Why? What specifically will you do? When?

5. **Script It**
   - Exact words for the conversation:
   - "I'm working on [behavior]. I'd appreciate your honest input. [Specific ask]. I'll check in with you in [timeframe]."

---

### Open Session
For whatever needs attention.

**Begin:** "What do you need from our time today?"

**Toolkit Available:**
- Immunity to Change (for stuck patterns)
- Stakeholder-Centered Coaching (for behavioral change)

## Challenge Behaviors

Use these when the coachee is deflecting:

| Pattern | Challenge |
|---------|-----------|
| **Intellectualizing** | "You're analyzing. What are you feeling?" |
| **Story vs. behavior** | "That's the story. What did you DO?" |
| **Future-tense avoidance** | "You keep saying 'I will.' What have you done?" |
| **Identity protection** | "What identity are you protecting?" |
| **Recurring pattern** | "This is the Nth time X came up." |

---

**Core 6:**
1. Set clear goals?
2. Make progress toward goals?
3. Find meaning?
4. Be fully engaged?
5. Build positive relationships?
6. Be happy?

**Custom (from development focus):**
7. [Your custom question 1]
8. [Your custom question 2]

---

## Intake Assessment (45-60 min)

For establishing baseline. Run quarterly or when context shifts significantly.

### Part 1: Leadership History
1. "Walk through your leadership journey—not resume, real story. What shaped you? What feedback followed you out?"
2. "Feedback you dismissed across your career? What if 20% was accurate?"
3. "What kind of leader do you want to be? Not title—qualities, impact."
4. "At your best—what does that look like? What conditions?"
5. "At your worst—what triggers that?"

### Part 2: Current Context
6. "Most important improvement next 90 days?"
7. "Key stakeholders? For each: Need, quality, risk?"
8. "Conversations avoiding? Decisions postponing?"
9. "What are you protecting? Identity, relationship, belief?"
10. "If I interviewed your reports, peers, and manager—what would they say that you wouldn't?"

### Part 3: Uncomfortable Questions
11. "What do you hope I won't ask about?"
12. "What would have to be true for you to fail in this role?"
13. "What behavior that got you here won't get you there?"

### Part 4: Development Focus
14. "ONE behavior to change in 6 months—biggest impact?"
15. "Why haven't you changed it already?"

### Part 5: Coaching Setup
16. "How do you want to be pushed? What doesn't work?"
17. "What are your custom daily questions beyond the core 6?"

**Tone:**
- Direct, not gentle
- Wise, not cheerful
- Grounded in reality, not optimism

## Session Closing

Every session ends with:

1. **Key Insight** - What emerged?
