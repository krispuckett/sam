# Work Guardrails

These are if-then rules for managing yourself at Stripe.

---

## Energy Management

**IF** energy is Red **THEN** only do:
- Required meetings (can't reschedule)
- Inbox triage
- No feedback delivery, no hard conversations
- Flag to manager if multiple Red days

**IF** energy is Yellow **THEN**:
- Do ONE important thing, protect it
- Don't schedule additional 1:1s
- Keep conversations shorter
- It's okay to be quieter than usual

**IF** energy is Green **THEN**:
- Load up the calendar if needed
- Have the hard conversations
- Do deep critique work
- Invest in relationships

## Meetings

**IF** a meeting has no agenda **THEN** ask for one before accepting.

**IF** you're in a meeting and unclear why **THEN** ask: "What do you need from me here?"

**IF** you're double-booked **THEN** prioritize: reports > stakeholders > general.

**IF** Friday afternoon has meetings **THEN** try to move them (protect review time).

---

## Feedback

**IF** you notice something worth feedback **THEN** note it immediately (don't trust memory).

**IF** feedback is critical **THEN** deliver in 1:1, not in group settings.

**IF** you're unsure whether to give feedback **THEN** ask: "Would I want to know this?"

**IF** feedback has been sitting more than a week **THEN** you're avoiding it. Deliver it.

---

## Team Health

**IF** a report seems off two meetings in a row **THEN** name it directly.

**IF** you don't know how someone is really doing **THEN** you haven't asked the right question yet.

**IF** someone is struggling and you feel the urge to solve it **THEN** pause. Ask first.

**IF** tension exists between reports **THEN** don't triangulate. Get them in a room.

---

## Stakeholders

**IF** you haven't talked to your manager in 5+ days **THEN** send an async update.

**IF** cross-functional friction emerges **THEN** address it directly, don't complain sideways.

**IF** you need something from someone you don't know **THEN** find a warm intro or coffee chat first.

---

## Scope & Boundaries

**IF** asked to do IC work **THEN** ask: "Is this a gap I should fill, or a gap we should hire for?"

**IF** you're doing work your reports should do **THEN** stop and delegate.

**IF** a project seems too big **THEN** break it down before panicking.

**IF** you're spending >50% of time on non-team work **THEN** something is wrong.

---

## First 90 Days Specific

**IF** urge to change something arises in Days 1-30 **THEN** write it down, don't act.

**IF** you don't understand something **THEN** ask. No one expects you to know yet.

**IF** you feel behind **THEN** you're not. You're on schedule. Learning is the job.

**IF** someone tests you early **THEN** stay calm, be clear, don't overreact.

---

## Emergency

**IF** you're completely overwhelmed **THEN** talk to your manager same day.

**IF** health crashes multiple days **THEN** communicate, don't hide.

**IF** you need to say no **THEN** say no. You can explain why, but the no stands.
