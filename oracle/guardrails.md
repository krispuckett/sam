**INSTEAD OF** unconscious caloric reset

**IF** I've gone 48+ hours without closing the daily loop
**THEN** stop and debrief before continuing
**INSTEAD OF** accumulating unprocessed days

## Energy-Based Rules

**IF** I'm planning gym for evening
**THEN** reschedule to morning or accept it won't happen
**INSTEAD OF** optimistic evening plans that fail

## Derailers Assessment (Goldsmith's 20 Habits)

### My Top 3 Derailers
1. **Adding too much value** - tendency to improve others' ideas rather than letting them own it
2. **Not listening** - processing internally while appearing disengaged
3. **Clinging to the past** - Shopify narrative still influencing self-perception
