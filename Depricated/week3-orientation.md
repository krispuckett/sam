# Week 3 Orientation — Tuesday Feb 3, 2026

## Your Role Right Now (3 Hats)

1. **Manager** — 4 reports, 3 teams (Reporting, Accounting, Startups), hiring #5
2. **IC Bridge** — filling a gap, time-boxed, wrap it up
3. **Learner** — product, systems, culture, team dynamics

**Perry's right.** Nothing is on fire. Week 3 is intake, not output. The instinct to stay one step ahead is good — but the risk is you sprint on everything and burn recovery capacity you need for months 2-3.

## Daily Time Blocks

| Time | Block | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 8:30–10:00 | Deep work | IC work this week → product learning next week |
| 10:00–12:30 | Meetings/team time | Crits, syncs, 1:1s |
| 12:30–1:00 | Lunch | Actually eat. |
| 1:00–2:00 | Low-energy | Slack catch-up, async reviews, reading |
| 2:00–3:00 | Meetings overflow | Stakeholder time |
| 3:00+ | Wrap | Debrief, prep tomorrow |

## This Week's 3 Priorities (Not 10)

1. **Wrap IC work** — get it to a hand-off point
2. **Observe team rhythms** — crit today, 1:1s this week. Take notes, don't fix yet.
3. **Start Oracle intake** — even 30 min gets the baseline in

## What to NOT Do This Week

- Don't redesign team processes yet
- Don't try to learn the entire product
- Don't solve the "teams not pushing hard enough" problem — just observe and note

## Pattern Watch

You said "I don't want to repeat patterns of the past." The pattern to watch right now is over-functioning in week 3 to prove yourself, then crashing. Perry gave you explicit permission to go slow. Take it.

## Today: Tuesday Feb 3

**Meetings:**
- 10:00am — STAR design crit (observing)
- ~11:00am — Accounting-RADS
- 12:30pm — Lauren/Kris
- 2:00pm — Anna meet & greet
- 3:15pm — GI doc

**Between meetings:** Pick ONE thing to push forward. The IC work has a finish line — that's the obvious candidate.

**Iron day** — Day 64, tonight.

## Health Context

- Sleep: 90% / 7h 18m / Sleep bank +2h surplus
- Recovery: 55% / HRV 21ms (trending down from 30 over 3 days)
- Nauseous this morning — eat something before the next meeting
- Orientation: moderate-effort day. Don't stack more than what's here.
