## Day 1 Reminders

This is not a normal work day. This is the first day of a new chapter.

- You don't need to prove anything today
- Silence is fine. Questions are better than answers.
- Energy will be high — don't confuse that with capacity
- Take notes on paper if screens feel awkward
- Eat. Hydrate. Don't skip it because you're nervous.

## Questions to Answer Today

- Who are your direct reports?
- What's your manager's communication preference?
- What's the team working on right now?
- When's your first 1:1 with each report?
- What's the domain you're designing for?

### Energy Reflection
Good first day overall. Excited to be here. A lot to soak in, easy to feel behind but that's normal. Evening at hotel was restorative — worked on systems, decompressed.
